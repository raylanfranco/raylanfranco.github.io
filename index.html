                                            My foray into web development began with a curiosity I discovered while seated in a Comp Sci course over six years ago.
                                            That curiosity transformed itself into passion, and that passion led me to build an entire career from the ground up with nothing
                                            but the knowledge I gained from online courses.

                                            I do a ton of digital art on my own using an iPad application called Procreate. Lots of the artists who I look up to are huge on
                                            asset design, and in my quest to become a better artist, graphic design became a natural skill for me. Using the extensive Envato
                                            Elements, I now craft elements for my art and web design. Not to mention I'm ACE with memes.

                                I have over <span>7 years</span> of experience working with front-end technologies, the Adobe Suite, Squarespace, and Salesforce. I take pride in being the listening ear that makes your visions come to fruition.

                                I am an autodidactic learner who taught myself everything that I know today, and my ambition has seen me participate in the authoring and completion of a wide array of projects. I have a passion for both development and design, and am a digital artist
                                in my spare time, and so I have merged my expertise as a Software Engineer with the world of UX/UI and graphic design. The marriage of these disciplines has resulted in a wonderful career that I am pleased to have created of my own volition.</p>

                                            My journey as a front-end web developer began with the creation of Rogue UX, a freelancing monicker I
                                            created in class when I was attending community college. This was my first foray into the world of
                                            self-education, and I knew that it would pay off so long as I continued. It did.

                                            Saatchi & Saatchi served as my formal introduction into the world of advertising. I was the second
                                            developer on a team of two, producing work under the Toyota account. The amount of experience I
                                            gained in a structured environment paled in comparison to the first three years I spent
                                            freelancing on my own, and what started off as a shoddy set of skills soon turned into
                                            prowess.

                                            With all that I learned at Saatchi & Saatchi, I felt confident enough to move back into the world
                                            of freelancing. I have now expanded my skills beyond the realm of front-end web development and
                                            have moved into backend development, graphic design, UX/UI design, and customization on all of the world's most

                                            My journey at Vermillion Sky introduced me to an entirely new world of technologies and an entirely new way of seeing code.
                                            I was introduced to Uncle Bob's clean code architecture, as well as React, React Native, MobX, and a myriad of other languages, frameworks, and packages.
                                            I had the privilege of helping to develop an app called Black Privilege, which served as a Yelp-alternative for black-owned businesses in the Kansas City area.

                                            During the world's most trying time, I ventured out west to Dallas, Texas to forge a new narrative for myself. I joined with Corgan, an architecture firm making massive strides
                                            in the worlds of education, aviation, and data center development. I took full ownership over the front-end, developing the firm's core application, which would be used across all
                                            of Corgan's branches.

                                    “Everyone holds his fortune in his own hands, like a sculptor the raw material he will fashion into a figure. But it’s the same with that type of artistic activity as with all others: We are merely born with the capability to do it. The skill to mold the material into what we want must be learned and attentively cultivated.”

                                    My sense of worth as a human comes from my penchant to seek out things that cause me to evolve; I pride myself on being a learner who isn't afraid to fall down and scrape his knees in the process.
                                    With so much information at our fingertips in the modern age, I feel that we are at the forefront of our own evolution, and as a result of this, we should always put ourselves in situations that
                                    actively challenge us to live outside of our comfort zone. I learned about neuroplasticity - the brain's ability to form new neural connections as a result of experience - many years ago,
                                    and since then, it has led me to throw convention to the wind and to author my own experience. What you see here on this portfolio is not the result of careful planning and following rules, but the product of carving my own path.
